IMAGE PASSWORD:golden

The Application
	The Application is created by using the steganography.js library  that is free online. I implemented it in this application. However, I add an encryption system so that whenever someone used the same library the correct message in the image I created will not appear.

In Encoding: Only common ASCII codes are included because a lot of it are not printable. The library can encode all the ascii codes, however, because of the encryption method that I used, it became limited.

In Decoding: wrong password = wrong message
